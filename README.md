# DIY-PR22-PIC16F876A
Sample source code for DIY PR22. Project description : This PIC microcontroller based project uses PIC16F876A to interface with HMC6352 compass module, AD7746 capacitive sensor and SCP1000 barometric pressure sensor. Now you can measure the heading direction, capacitance, air pressure and temperature. Compatible with MPLAB IDE with HITECH C compiler, MPLABX with HITECH C compiler v9.83/v9.80 and XC8 compiler.

There is 3 folder which are Source code C, Sample code using MPLABX and sample code using MPLAB(Using MPLAB 8.6 And HiTech 9.80) Welcome to our tecnical forum for any inquiry.
